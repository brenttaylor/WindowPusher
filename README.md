WindowPusher
============
Being dissatisfied with current virtual desktop software, I set out to create my own.  Requires Python 2.7 and wxPython.

Controls
--------
Win+Alt+Right  : Moves one desktop space to the right.
Win+Alt+Left   : Moves one desktop space to the left.
Win+Ctrl+Right : Moves current window one desktop space to the right.
Win+Ctrl+Left  : Moves current window one desktop space to the left.

Todo
----
Just the basics are currently working.  There are a fixed number of desktops and no way currently to change the controls.
